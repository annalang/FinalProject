<p id="title"> Tau Sigma Phi; Delta Chapter Brock University </p>
<h1> Our Story </h1>
<p>
	Tau Sigma Phi was founded on September 9th, 2007 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada at Carleton University.
	Our Founding Mothers; Kristin Dafoe, Halley Van Muyen, Natasha Hjort, Sarah Jones, and Sara Korajian;
	united to build a foundation for women based on friendship and, more importantly, sisterhood. </p>

 <p>
	The five founding mothers of Tau Sigma Phi were all united on one solid front, unified by their
	equally shared definition of sisterhood. This theme became the foundation upon which Tau Sigma Phi was
	established. Their hardships were shared equally and each sister undyingly supported one another.
	Loyalty was the most important value the five founding mothers agreed was of utmost worth. It was
	evident from day one, that these five women shared the same values and beliefs of sisterhood, loyalty,
	 and integrity, which is inevitably what drew them together. They felt as though they had no other
	 choice but to found an organization that would attract women who felt as passionately as they did,
	 and thus, the letters Tau, Sigma and Phi were a clear preference in the name they chose to bestow
	 upon themselves, to be known eternally as True Sisters Forever.
</p> <p>

	 On July 19th, 2015, Tau Sigma Phi â€“ Delta chapter was founded in St. Catharines, Ontario, at Brock
	 University. The hard work of the 5 Founding Sisters, Emily Wendel, Amalia Banava, Sophie Ford,
	 Jaclyn Macros and Amanda Bourdeau, made this chapter successful from day one. </p>
